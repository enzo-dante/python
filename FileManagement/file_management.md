# modes for opening files

r - read a file (no writing) - this is the default behavior

w - write a file (previous content will be removed)
    * can write to a pre-existing or create a new file

a - append to a file (previous content will NOT be removed)
    * can write to a pre-existing or create a new file
    * append does not allow for cursor control
    * only adds to end

r+ - read and write to a file (writing based on cursor)
    * requires a pre-existing file
    * r+ by default adds to beginning/seek(0)

# READING FILES option 1: open()/read()

> use open(file_name) & opened_file.read() to read files in python

ex:

> story.txt

'this story is really short
This is awkward'

> reading_files.py

my_file = open("story.txt")
my_file.read()

__after reading a file, you need return cursor back to the start of the file__

# file cursor movement

> after reading a file, use seek() to set cursor to specific position
>
> for documentation, refer to:
>
>       help(file_object)

__default -r flag is included in open(file_name)__

my_file = open("story.txt")
my_file.read() # 'this story is really short
This is awkward'

my_file.read() # ''

__file.seek(0) = bring file back to beginning__

my_file.seek(0) # 'this story is really short\nThis is awkward'

__file.readline() = read the first line__

my_file.readline() # 'this story is really short'

my_file.readline() # 'This is awkward'

__file.readlines() = preserve lines and places them in a list__

my_file.readlines() # 'this story is really short
This is awkward'

> file_object.close() = ALWAYS close a file after use to free up computational resources

my_file = open("story.txt")
my_file.read()

my_file.close()
my_file.closed # True

__if closed, the file_object cannot be read again until re-opened__

my_file = open("story.txt")
my_file.read()

my_file.close()

# READING FILES option 2: with Block statements

__default -r flag is included in open(file_name)__

with open("story.txt") as file:
    data = file.read()

__using with automatically closes a file__

    # file.__exit__()/file.close() is automatically called

print(file.closed) # True

# WRITE ("w") = overriding existing content in target file

> to write to a pre-existing or non-existing (will be created) files, you still have to open() a file

> SUPERIOR write option:

__add -w flag to write in open()__

__-w flag overrides orginal content__

__to test write, go into terminal run: python3 file_name__

# r+ = read and write based on cursor position in PRE-EXISTING file

> r+ (read & write default at beginning) REQUIRES a pre-existing and you still have to open() a file

> SUPERIOR write option:

# pickle: convert python into unreadable data for storage

> pickle external module will serialize into a byte stream -- akin to putting it into a jar for storage and can be deserialized back into a python object on command
